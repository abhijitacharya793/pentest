# HTTP Request Smuggling

{% hint style="info" %}
**Description**

This vulnerability occurs when a desyncronization between **front-end** proxies and the **back-end** server allows an attacker to send an HTTP request that will be interpreted as a single request by the front-end proxies (load balance/reverse-proxy) and as 2 request by the back-end server.

**Recommendation**
