# Cookie Bomb

A cookie bomb aims to adding a large number of big cookies to a user for a domain and its subdomains. As a result, a user will send very huge requests to a server (due to the big cookies) that a server will refuse. Therefore, it will cause a client-side DoS in that domains and subdomains.
